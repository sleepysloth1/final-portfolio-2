    <p>
        <p>Hi,</p>
        
        <p>My name is <b>Sleepysloth </b>, and I am quite a sleepy sloth. I’m a senior at Brown University studying Behavioral Decision Sciences and Data Fluency. I took this course – UI/UX – because I am fascinated by the way humans make decisions and how web interfaces can influence the way people make decisions. Furthermore, my hope coming out of this class was to understand the optimal user experience that fits best in our mental models of how something works.</p> 
        
        <p>So, while i’m not a CS major, I thought it would be interesting to take this class as it allows me to explore human behavior through interface design, and combine my interests of technology and design into one course. </p>
        
        <p>On this page, you will find my portfolio as a UI/UX student and the work I have completed thus far in the class. I hope that by exploring the page, you will see my growth as a UI/UX designer. Despite my coding skills not being top notch, I've definitely taken the principles of this course with me and am excited for the future in which I can implement the lessons of human behavior we studied in class.</p>
        <p>The <b>theme</b> I want to emphasize in my porfolio is growth. As you will see as you go through each project, the submissions get better with each project. </p>
        <p>My <b>narrative</b> as a UIUX student is that this portolio is designed to convey my journey as a student. Clearly, there were some bumps in the road as my stylistic display is not what I would have hoped for, but the lessons learned are still there and can be seen in the <b>hierarchy, the context, the narrative, the content, and the presentation</b> </p>

    </p>

      <h3>Personas and Storyboarding</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity"></p>

      <p> <b>Context/Problem </b> - The context of this project is to understand different users and how their needs are different. In researching this, the problem that needed to be solved was how can we make a more intuitive interface for people using common interfaces such as grocery checkouts, public transit ticket systems, and ordering food at kiosks. This matters because designing with a purpose is very important and should be highly considered when designing interfaces for the broadest set of people. </p>
      <p> <b>Research/Feedback</b> - The research consisted of me observing customers order bubble tea from inside the tea house’s kiosk. I then asked them questions about their experience. Past work that is similar to this is ethnographic research, which I considered when asking the customers questions about their experience. </p>
      <p><b>Design Iterations </b> - Instead of doing one storyboard, I made two so that I could better practice my storyboarding techniques.
      <p><b>Conclusion</b> - I learned that many different people go for bubble tea and that their needs differ. In fact, the payment method was the most surprising thing I learned. I learned that many international students would prefer to have alternative methods to pay (this statement came from one international student) and that apple pay shouldn’t be the only method.</p>

      <h3>Responsive Redesign</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity"></p>
      <p><p> <b>Context/Problem </b> - The objective of this project was to find a webpage that could use a bit of a glow up. So I chose to revamp Bristol Township’s website that was quite old and didn’t have many modern designs nor did it have a good user experience.  So, my goal was to fix the usability and functionality of the website to create a better viewing and more functional experience for the user. 
      </p>
      <p> <b>Research/Feedback</b> - Our audience here is likely the residents of Bristol Township, PA. I based my design off of the websites that host Rhode Island townships’ websites as they have very functional and clean designs and experiences.
      </p>
      <p><b>Design Iterations </b> - I used many wireframes to start my design process and come to a set plan. The only trade off would be that if someone is used to the old design, they may be surprised coming to the new website and having to relearn the interface. But,  given that I designed a highly learnable interface, I don’t see it being a big problem
      </p>
      <p><b>Conclusion</b> - I learned that many new township websites seem to use a similar website layout that is clean and effective.

      <h3>Iterative Design</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity"></p>
      <p><p> <b>Context/Problem </b> - In this project, my group and I designed a hypothetical website for a real start-up. Our start-up is Lancey. We were tasked with creating many different wireframes that would show how users would interact with the site, and then finally we built the site. In addition to this, we used real testers from Usertesting.com that made comments and suggestions about our website.
      </p>
      <p> <b>Research/Feedback</b> - Our audience is users of Lancey, so in this case, likely UIUX professionals. Lancey is a technology company that allows you to create high fidelity mockups in an easy and shareable way.
      </p>
      <p><b>Design Iterations </b> - We considered many designs but learned that, throughout our group critique, and our own multiple wireframes, that big icons and clear hierarchy were essential throughout the process.
      </p>
      <p><b>Conclusion</b> - We learned that some users struggled with our hierarchy of items, but that the overall interface looked clean and was intuitive.

      <h3>Development</h3>
      <p><p> <b>Context/Problem </b> - The purpose of this project was to test our skills and learn about React. In doing so, we needed to create a webpage that was responsive and where you could filter results and add them to your cart. For the purposes of this project, I designed a Ceremony Tea website. Users can view the different coffees and beverages that Ceremony offers, can sort them buy price and calorie count, and can add them to a cart to checkout.
      </p>
      <p> <b>Research/Feedback</b> - In doing my research, I looked at how shopping websites are currently designed. Many of them have a common theme but Ceremony Tea’s website brings you to another third party site in order to choose your drink and checkout. I sought to cut the middleman out and make it so that you can buy drinks directly on their home website.
      </p>
      <p><b>Design Iterations </b> - My interactions included how i should lay out the drinks, whether i should organize my category or have them all on one page. I decided to have them all on one page as there aren’t many drinks. The only trade off for this is that in the future if I wanted to add more drinks to the page, I would want to create separate tabs for each category of drink to make the user experience more enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p><b>Conclusion</b> - Through this project, I learned how to use React and how I can redesign a commonly used website for the better.
